# Is it `20XX` yet??

Probably not...

## What is `20XX`?

`20XX`, also pronounced as twenty exty ex, is a short hand seen in some video games to mean "sometime in the near future".

When I played the Megaman series, I would also see `201X` (twenty exteen) or `202X` (twenty twenty ex). But as each decade comes and goes, each version ends up becoming outdated. The fix? `20XX`.

## But are we even going to make it to `20XX`??

This site is dedicated to the future and to optimism! *Here's to **`21XX`**!*
